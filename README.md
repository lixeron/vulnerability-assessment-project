# vulnerability-assessment-project
This is a basic vulnerability assessment tool I created. This should not be used on just any network/system and only should be used in an area with permission and a controlled environment.

I will probably expand on this project/stuff more

What this tool does:
It automates the process of scanning for vulnerabilities in networks using Python and nmap. it is designed to identify open ports and detected potential vulnerabilities in a target system or networks.
Running the script: python vulnerability_scanner.py
Promopted to enter target IP or IP range with permission to scan.
Example:
Enter the target IP or range: 192.168.1.1 
Scanning 192.168.1.1 for open ports... 
Host: 192.168.1.1 (hostname.example) 
State: Up ---------- 
Protocol: tcp port: 80	state: open 
port: 443	state: open 
Scanning 192.168.1.1 for vulnerabilities... 
Port: 80, Script: vulners, Output: [Vulnerability details]

The expected outputs should display the state of the host (up/down).
Lists all openports within the scanned range and their state (open/closed)
Outputs any vulnerabilities found using the Vulners Nmap script detailing the port and associated vulnerability information.

Again, I tested this in a controlled environment and on my own home wifi. Please do not use this and if you do ensure you have legal permission to do so. It is intended for me to learn not to abuse.
